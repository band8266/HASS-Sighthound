# HASS-Sighthound
[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) custom component for people detection with [Sighthound Cloud](https://www.sighthound.com/products/cloud). To use Sighthound Cloud you must register with Sighthound to get an api key. The Sighthound Developer tier (free for non-commercial use) allows 5000 requests per month. If you need more requests per month you will need to sign up for a production account (i.e. Basic or Pro account).

This component adds an image processing entity where the state of the entity is the number of `people` detected in an image. The number of `faces` are exposed as an attribute of the sensor. Note that whenever a face is detected in an image, a person is **always** detected. However a person can be detected without a face being detected (e.g. if they have their back to the camera). Note that in order to prevent accidentally using up your requets to Sighthound, by default the component will **not** automatically scan images, but requires you to call the `image_processing.scan` service e.g. using an automation triggered by motion. Alternativley, periodic scanning can be enabled by configuring a `scan_interval`.

If `save_file_folder` is configured, on each new detection of a person an annotated image with the name `sighthound_latest.jpg` is saved in the configured folder if it doesnt already exist, and over-written if it does exist. The `sighthound_latest.jpg` image shows the bounding box around detected people and can be displayed on the Home Assistant front end using a local_file camera, and used in notifications.

For each person detected, an `image_processing.person_detected` event is fired. The event data includes the `entity_id` of the image processing entity firing the event, and the bounding box around the detected person. Similarly, for each face detected an `image_processing.face_detected` event is fired, which in addition to the bounding box and entity_id contains the `age` and `gender` of the face. To see these events in your logs, configure the logger level to `debug`.

Place the `custom_components` folder in your configuration directory (or add its contents to an existing `custom_components` folder). Add to your Home-Assistant config:

```yaml
image_processing:
  - platform: sighthound
    api_key: your_api_key
    save_file_folder: /config/www/
    #Â scan_interval: 30 # optional, in seconds
    source:
      - entity_id: camera.local_file
```

Configuration variables:
- **api_key**: Your developer api key.
- **account_type**: (Optional, default `dev` for Developer) If you have a paid account, used `prod`.
- **save_file_folder**: (Optional) The folder to save processed images to. Note that folder path should be added to [whitelist_external_dirs](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/basic/)
- **source**: Must be a camera.

## Displaying the `sighthound_latest.jpg` image
It is easy to display the `sighthound_latest.jpg` image with a [local_file](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/local_file) camera. An example configuration is:

```yaml
camera:
  - platform: local_file
    file_path: /config/www/sighthound_latest.jpg
    name: sighthound
```

## Automation to send the `sighthound_latest.jpg` file in a notification
Configure the [folder_watcher](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/folder_watcher/) to watch the directory containing your configured  `save_file_folder`. In `configuration.yaml`, e.g.:

```yaml
folder_watcher:
  - folder: /config/www/
```

Then in `automations.yaml` we can use a notification platform such as [Telegram](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/telegram/) to send a notification including the image when `sighthound_latest.jpg` is updated:

```yaml
- id: '1527837198169'
  alias: New Sighthound detection
  trigger:
    platform: event
    event_type: folder_watcher
    event_data:
      file : sighthound_local_file_latest.jpg
  action:
    - service: telegram_bot.send_photo
      data:
        file: /config/www/sighthound_local_file_latest.jpg
  ```

## Count people using the `image_processing.person_detected` event
Using a [counter](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/counter) an automation can be used to count the number of people seen. In `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
counter:
  people_counter:
    name: People
    icon: mdi:alert
```

In `automations.yaml`:
```yaml
- id: 'peoplecounterautomation'
  alias: People Counting Automation
  trigger:
    platform: event
    event_type: image_processing.person_detected
    event_data:
      entity_id: image_processing.sighthound_local_file
  action:
    service: counter.increment
    entity_id: counter.people_counter
```

The counter is incremented each time a person is detected. The bounding box can in principle be used to include/exclude people based on their location in the image. TODO: add example of using bounding box.

## Info on the bounding box
The bounding boxes are formatted to be consumed by the `image_processing.draw_box()` function. The formatting convention is [identical](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/image/draw_bounding_boxes) to that used by Tensorflow, where the bounding box is defined by the tuple `(y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max)` where the coordinates are floats in the range `[0.0, 1.0]` and relative to the width and height of the image.
